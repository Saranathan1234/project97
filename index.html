    <h2>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. 
        Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: according to Hans Eysenck: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".
        Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal correspondence with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. 
        In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",and some recently proven but highly advanced results.
    <br>
        During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations. Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research.
        Of his thousands of results, all but a dozen or two have now been proven correct. The Ramanujan Journal, a scientific journal, was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his notebooks—containing summaries of his published and unpublished results—have been analysed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas. 
        As late as 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about "simple properties" and "similar outputs" for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death.He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. 
        Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a single look was enough to show they could have been written only by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.
    <br>
        In 1919, ill health—now believed to have been hepatic amoebiasis (a complication from episodes of dysentery many years previously)—compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32. 
        His last letters to Hardy, written in January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new mathematical ideas and theorems. His "lost notebook", containing discoveries from the last year of his life, caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered in 1976.
        A deeply religious Hindu, Ramanujan credited his substantial mathematical capacities to divinity, and said the mathematical knowledge he displayed was revealed to him by his family goddess Namagiri Thayar.
        He once said, "An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.</p>

    <h3>THEOREMS BY SRINIVASA RAMANUJAM</h3>
    <br>
    <p>HARDY-RAMANUJAN THEOREM</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Ramanujan%27s_%22Master_Theorem%22_page.jpg">
    <br>
     <p>In mathematics, the Hardy-Ramanujan theorem, proved by G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1917), states that the normal order of the number ω(n) of distinct prime factors of a number n is log(log(n)).
        Roughly speaking, this means that most numbers have about this number of distinct prime factors.</p>
        
        <p>*Prescise statement</p> 
        <p>A more precise version states that for any real-valued function ψ(n) that tends to infinity as n tends to infinity.</p>
        
           <p> {\displaystyle |\omega (n)-\log(\log(n))|<\psi (n){\sqrt {\log(\log(n))}}}|\omega (n)-\log(\log(n))|<\psi (n){\sqrt  {\log(\log(n))}}
            or more traditionally.</p>
        
            
            <p>{\displaystyle |\omega (n)-\log(\log(n))|<{(\log(\log(n)))}^{{\frac {1}{2}}+\varepsilon }}|\omega (n)-\log(\log(n))|<{(\log(\log(n)))}^{{{\frac  12}+\varepsilon }}
            for almost all (all but an infinitesimal proportion of) integers. That is, let g(x) be the number of positive integers n less than x for which the above inequality fails: then g(x)/x converges to zero as x goes to infinity.</p>
            
       <p>*History</p>
        <p>A simple proof to the result Turán (1934) was given by Pál Turán, who used the Turán sieve to prove that</p>
        
            <p>{\displaystyle \sum _{n\leq x}|\omega (n)-\log \log n|^{2}\ll x\log \log x\ .}\sum _{{n\leq x}}|\omega (n)-\log \log n|^{2}\ll x\log \log x\ .
            Generalizations
            The same results are true of Ω(n), the number of prime factors of n counted with multiplicity. This theorem is generalized by the Erdős-Kac theorem, which shows that ω(n) is essentially normally distributed.</p>

            <p>ROGER-RAMANUJAN IDENTITIES</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>In mathematics, the Rogers–Ramanujan identities are two identities related to basic hypergeometric series and integer partitions. 
                The identities were first discovered and proved by Leonard James Rogers (1894), and were subsequently rediscovered (without a proof) by Srinivasa Ramanujan some time before 1913. 
                Ramanujan had no proof, but rediscovered Rogers's paper in 1917, and they then published a joint new proof (Rogers & Ramanujan 1919). Issai Schur (1917) independently rediscovered and proved the identities.</p>

                <p>Definition</p>
                    <p> Rogers–Ramanujan identities are </p>
                    
                    <p>{\displaystyle G(q)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {q^{n^{2}}}{(q;q)_{n}}}={\frac {1}{(q;q^{5})_{\infty }(q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty }}}=1+q+q^{2}+q^{3}+2q^{4}+2q^{5}+3q^{6}+\cdots }{\displaystyle G(q)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {q^{n^{2}}}{(q;q)_{n}}}={\frac {1}{(q;q^{5})_{\infty }(q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty }}}=1+q+q^{2}+q^{3}+2q^{4}+2q^{5}+3q^{6}+\cdots } (sequence A003114 in the OEIS)
                    and</p>
                    
                    <p>{\displaystyle H(q)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {q^{n^{2}+n}}{(q;q)_{n}}}={\frac {1}{(q^{2};q^{5})_{\infty }(q^{3};q^{5})_{\infty }}}=1+q^{2}+q^{3}+q^{4}+q^{5}+2q^{6}+\cdots }{\displaystyle H(q)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {q^{n^{2}+n}}{(q;q)_{n}}}={\frac {1}{(q^{2};q^{5})_{\infty }(q^{3};q^{5})_{\infty }}}=1+q^{2}+q^{3}+q^{4}+q^{5}+2q^{6}+\cdots } (sequence A003106 in the OEIS).
                    Here, {\displaystyle (\cdot ;\cdot )_{n}}(\cdot ;\cdot )_{n} denotes the q-Pochhammer symbol.</p>
                    
                    <p> Combinatorial interpretation </p>
                    Consider the following:
                    
                   <p> {\displaystyle {\frac {q^{n^{2}}}{(q;q)_{n}}}}{\displaystyle {\frac {q^{n^{2}}}{(q;q)_{n}}}} </p>
                  <p>is the generating function for partitions with exactly {\displaystyle n}n parts such that adjacent parts have difference at least 2.</p>
                    <p>{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{(q;q^{5})_{\infty }(q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty }}}}{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{(q;q^{5})_{\infty }(q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty }}}} is the generating function for partitions such that each part is congruent to either 1 or 4 modulo 5.</p>
                    <p>{\displaystyle {\frac {q^{n^{2}+n}}{(q;q)_{n}}}}{\displaystyle {\frac {q^{n^{2}+n}}{(q;q)_{n}}}} is the generating function for partitions with exactly {\displaystyle n}n parts such that adjacent parts have difference at least 2 and such that the smallest part is at least 2.</p>
                    <p>{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{(q^{2};q^{5})_{\infty }(q^{3};q^{5})_{\infty }}}}{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{(q^{2};q^{5})_{\infty }(q^{3};q^{5})_{\infty }}}} is the generating function for partitions such that each part is congruent to either 2 or 3 modulo 5.</p>
                    The Rogers–Ramanujan identities could be now interpreted in the following way. Let {\displaystyle n}n be a non-negative integer.
                    
                   <p>The number of partitions of {\displaystyle n}n such that the adjacent parts differ by at least 2 is the same as the number of partitions of {\displaystyle n}n such that each part is congruent to either 1 or 4 modulo 5.
                    The number of partitions of {\displaystyle n}n such that the adjacent parts differ by at least 2 and such that the smallest part is at least 2 is the same as the number of partitions of {\displaystyle n}n such that each part is congruent to either 2 or 3 modulo 5.
                    Alternatively,
                    
                    The number of partitions of {\displaystyle n}n such that with {\displaystyle k}k parts the smallest part is at least {\displaystyle k}k is the same as the number of partitions of {\displaystyle n}n such that each part is congruent to either 1 or 4 modulo 5.
                    The number of partitions of {\displaystyle n}n such that with {\displaystyle k}k parts the smallest part is at least {\displaystyle k+1}k+1 is the same as the number of partitions of {\displaystyle n}n such that each part is congruent to either 2 or 3 modulo 5.</p>
                   <p> Modular functions
                    If q = e2πiτ, then q−1/60G(q) and q11/60H(q) are modular functions of τ.</p>
                    
                   <p> Applications
                    The Rogers–Ramanujan identities appeared in Baxter's solution of the hard hexagon model in statistical mechanics.</p>
                    
                   <p> Ramanujan's continued fraction is</p>
                    
                    <p>{\displaystyle 1+{\frac {q}{1+{\frac {q^{2}}{1+{\frac {q^{3}}{1+\cdots }}}}}}={\frac {G(q)}{H(q)}}.}1+{\frac  {q}{1+{\frac  {q^{2}}{1+{\frac  {q^{3}}{1+\cdots }}}}}}={\frac  {G(q)}{H(q)}}.</p>
                   <p> Relations to affine Lie algebras and vertex operator algebras
                    James Lepowsky and Robert Lee Wilson were the first to prove Rogers–Ramanujan identities using completely representation-theoretic techniques. They proved these identities using level 3 modules for the affine Lie algebra 
                    <p>{\displaystyle {\widehat {{\mathfrak {sl}}_{2}}}}{\displaystyle {\widehat {{\mathfrak {sl}}_{2}}}}.</p> 
                   <p> In the course of this proof they invented and used what they called {\displaystyle Z}Z-algebras. Lepowsky and Wilson's approach is universal, in that it is able to treat all affine Lie algebras at all levels. It can be used to find (and prove) new partition identities. First such example is that of Capparelli's identities discovered by Stefano Capparelli using level 3 modules for the affine Lie algebra {\displaystyle A_{2}^{(2)}}A_{2}^{{(2)}}.  </p>
